# ⚡ Numerical Methods Streamlit WebApp  

**Status:** In Progress 🚧  

---

## 📝 Description
An **interactive Streamlit app** for solving numerical equations.  
Supports common numerical methods like **Bisection** and **Newton-Raphson**, letting users input formulas, initial guesses, tolerance values, and iteration limits.  
Results are displayed in a **pandas DataFrame** for easy inspection.  

---

## 💡 Inspiration
Inspired by my **Numerical Methods class** in my Statistics major.  
Numerical analysis is everywhere from engineering problems to high-frequency financial processes and we use numerical methods in many real-world applications.  
This project is designed to help students **grasp methods intuitively** and **learn by doing**.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎛️ Dropdown to select numerical method: **Bisection**, **Newton-Raphson** (Secant & Fixed Point coming soon)  
- ✏️ Input fields for formulas, initial values, tolerance, and iteration count  
- 🔄 Iterative computation with automatic convergence checks  
- 📊 Results displayed in a **table format**
